# TrainActivity
Goal: To make a table that stores the information for theoretical trains input by the user. This is based around persistant web storage using Firebase.

# Goals
Not met. I'm having problems getting Firebase to play with pushing or recieving the data I'm trying to make it store. Details are commented at the top of /assets/javascript/app.js
